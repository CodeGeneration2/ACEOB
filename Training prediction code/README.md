# Training prediction code
Since our experiments have one main model, two control models and a runtime predictor. Therefore, we placed the four model codes separately.

We give a brief description of the 4 models below.


## E_code
The E_code model makes our main model and its code is in the E_code folder.

## No expert group E-code 350M
The no expert group E-code 350M model makes our main control model and its code is in the no expert group E-code 350M folder.

## GPT_NEO125M
The GPT_NEO125M model makes our control model and its code is in the GPT_NEO125M folder.

## Run time predictor
The run time predictor model allows us to train the run time predictor and its code is in the Run time predictor folder.
